# Introduction

## What is B/X BECMI Overlay Hack Delta?

B/X Overlay is set of house rules for your favorite B/X or BECMI style game.

Many of us find the B/X and associated rulesets to be preferable, but that they sometimes fall short because of the realities of a 1970's small publishing house and the desire to keep compatabilty between all adventures published during the TSR era.

## What are the main modifications?

-   Better 1st level survivability.
-   Guidelines for d20 style saves.
-   All character tables updated to align XP/Level and make each class more distinct.
-   All Character Classes go to 20.
    -  Fighter has an HP advantage over Dwarf.
    -  Cleric gets a Lay on Hands ability and a spell at 1st level.
    -  Wizard has more spell flexibility.
    -  Thief abilities expressed as a d20 roll.
    -  Halfling is more of a Fighter/Thief hybrid.
-   Characters get to roll HP at advantage at 1st level.
-   Alternate versions of all binary resolutions to be rollable on a D20.


-   Wizards can't memorize duplicate spells (more variety!).
-   Clerics are removed (scarier undead and injuries!).
-   Money is silver standard (more value for PC gold!).
-   Encumbrance is historical stone unites (easier numbers!).
-   Melee weapons each get a simple, unique benefit.
-   All the monsters and magic work like core D&D.
